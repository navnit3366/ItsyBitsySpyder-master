A Basic Python Program using python scrapy library to scrap websites. 

I have included my notes in [notes.md](notes.md) on what I have learn throughout making this.

## Prerequisite 
-------------------
Python

Scrapy version 2.0.0

 `git clone https://github.com/cont3nted/ItsyBitsySpyder.git`
 
 `pip install Scrapy`

## How to use it
--------------------
After cloning and pip installing the scrapy library,

just run `main.py` and key in the URL you want to scrap

and the extracted data will be put into the extracted_data folder.
